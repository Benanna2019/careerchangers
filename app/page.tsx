          There is a gap in the industry when it comes to software devs finding
          their first job. Many people go to a coding bootcamp only to{' '}

          I went through this experience myself. My coding bootcamp was great.
          My instructor was awesome. But the rest of the experience was lacking.
          I was left to figure out how to network and find a job on my own. The
          job hunting process and making connections was something that we were
          told we would get help with but we did not.

        <p>
          If you are curious about me, my name is Ben Patton. My background is
          in non-profit work and counseling. In non-profit work our income was
          through fundraising and so many fundraising principles can be applied
          to networking to help find a job. There are wonderful resources and I
          hope this is a place to not only help you learn how to network but
          also find resource and others going through the same journey as you so
          you know you are not alone.
