## The Idea

Changing careers is an idea. It begins with the idea that you can, we can, do something we have not been 'set up' to do.

When I began investigating how to change careers to be a software engineer it felt wrong. I background was military school. I worked in non-profit for 6 years and the skills I gained there were more what we would call 'soft-skills'. Soft skills are great but we have to also show we have the skill necessary for the job.

The idea of changing careers is immediately followed by the question, 'Is this possible? Am I crazy?'

Yes, it is. And no, you are not.

### My Story

In February 2020 I started teaching myself to code. My non-profit days were coming to an end and I had to figure out what I was going to do.

I had tried various things but coding was fueling. I could make things. I could sit down and solve problems. I could help others with things they cannot do themselves. I can put good into the world and make the world better through code.

#### Misconceptions

Although I loved coding I thought the path I would have to go on was either teach myself for 2 years while working a full-time job or go back to school and rack up a lot of debt.

I was wrong. I did not have to do any of that and this is becoming more common across multiple career fields.

The days of formalized education to gain a skill to get a job are changing. You don't have to get a bachelor's degree, associate degree, or take that long.

#### Coding Bootcamp

I found out about coding bootcamps in June of 2020. It seemed unfathomable to me that I could pay $10,000 and in 3 months have a skill that I could start out making $40 - $50,000.

But the more I investigated I found out not only are coding bootcamps popping up everywhere, they had been around for longer than I thought and there was one near me.

So I decided to go with a local bootcamp in Charleston, South Carolina called Jack Russell Coding School.

This was the advice that led me to that decision:

> Choose the tech you want to learn that is marketable in your area and choose the coding bootcamp that teaches that tech. Coding bootcamp lasted 3months. A month later I had a part-time job. A month after that I had my first full-time job.

#### The Others (Not the others from Lost)

So that is all well and good but that is just coding right?

No, currently there is a wave of individuals changing careers to SaaS-Sales (software as a service sales).

The point of this newsletter is to share stories and advice for helping those seeking to change careers do so more effectively.

Another goal is to find out the paths that are opening up to allow people to 'break-in' to a different career field and get the word out.

The end goal is to spread the word that changing careers is possible.

Thanks and I am looking forward being on this journey with you.

Till next time,

Ben Patton
