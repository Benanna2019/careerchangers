## Weekly Reminder

As you change careers and are learning a skill, don't forget to share with the world what you're learning or working on.

1. Write that LinkedIn post
2. Write that blog post
3. Ship what your working on
4. Share what you shipped ðŸ‘†

What did you work on this week? Share it on LinkedIn and tag me so I can share it as well.

## The Minimum Spanning Stack

I came across this idea a little while back. For those changing careers I think it can offer great peace of mind and clarity.

The idea comes from Shawn Wang, or Swyx as he goes by in the developer community and on twitter.

As developers, specifically as software developers looking to get a job we often get caught up in trying to learn whatever will get us a job.

That seems good but what it often means is that you don't go deep on any tech or and tech stack.

Enter, _**The Minimum Spanning Stack**_

The idea here is that you have a tech stack that you can build anything with and you can build fast.

So if you are in a bootcamp or graduating a bootcamp, focus on building with what you learned.

- Focus on building great projects
- Focus on developing out those skills and going deep on them

And most importantly: When you are applying for jobs, and you demo what you know, <span className="underline font-semibold italic">they are looking to see that you know how to do what they are looking for not necessarily that you know how to do it with their tech</span>.

If you know the concepts, and you have built with one tech stack, you can learn the company's tech stack but that is on company time.

Focus on building great projects. Learning a concept. And then if you have to learn something new, let it be on company time. Don't try to learn all of it because that will make you burnout fast.

Thanks everyone!

Till next time,

Ben
