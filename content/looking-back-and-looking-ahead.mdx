Happy last day of 2022! That is so wild to say.

I hope you are well and if you celebrate the holidays that you have had a wonderful time.

Today, for me, is a day of remembering everything that happened in 2022 and being grateful. It is also a day to look forward with eager expectation of what the new year will bring.

As we all come to the end of another year we tend to look ahead and hope the next year will be better than this year. I would encourage you to look back on all the good and hard things of 2022 and find the things to be thankful for.

I am not where I thought I would be coming to the end of 2022. In many ways I believe I have had to let go of some hopes and dreams and, dang it, that hurts. But there have also been so many awesome things that have happened in our lives this year that we can be thankful for.

My aim for this newsletter is that it would help others think a little differently about finding jobs and help many find their first job in a new career field. But my goal is also larger. I want to help others face these hard situations with more internal settledness.

Career changing is risky and anxiety inducing because change/transition always rattles us a bit. What was something we could be sure of, is not sure any longer. No matter how bad we want a better situation we still feel the weight of what we are pursing. And this weight tends to be one that is mental, emotional, and psychological.

So here's to a more internal settledness in 2023.

<NetworkingCallout title="Understanding Luck" image={`/images/looking-back-and-looking-ahead/lbalanetworking.png`}>

When it comes to getting a job, too many people becoming cynical and angry and rage that the whole process is just a matter of _**luck**_.

We tend to think that getting a job is on par with going viral. We don't know when it will happen, how it will happen, or if it will happen but we are gonna keep trying and just hope it works out.

Let's talk about increasing our luck and what it has to do with networking.

**4 Types of Luck**
This was written about recently by [Sahil Bloom](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7014937174479413248/) and Shawn Wang [(@Swyx)](https://twitter.com/swyx) has written about it [here](https://www.swyx.io/create-luck/). The idea here is that yes, many things can be accredited to 'luck.' But we have the distinct ability to increase our 'luck surface area' or, as Swyx says, 'create luck.'

So here are the four types of luck, what they mean, and most importantly, how to use them.

1. **Blind Luck** - This is the random chance luck that we all kind of believe we are forced to submit too in the job application process. You can't really utilize this or do anything with this. So we move on
2. **Luck From Motion** - You put in time and effort to creating, what Sahil labels, 'collisions.' This is where you are actively participating in an ecosystem and collisions are interaction and conversations with others in that ecosystem/domain. Think of it like bumper cars. If you don't get in the arena the chance that someone will bump into you is virtually zero, unless by random luck a crazy event happens and that bumper car comes out of the arena and hits you. But luck from motion is getting in a bumper car in the arena and playing the game.
3. **Luck From Awareness** - This is basically you know what you are talking about. If we were to try to make our bumper car analogy work, it's like you have gone to the same arena for 5 years on the weekend and everyone knows who you are. Someone may show up, no nothing about you, but because you have shown up consistently and are a bumper car champion, they will notice you and probably say something to you afterwards. This is what we want to get to by posting on LinkedIn, keeping up a blog, and having good projects. Build cool things, and talk, talk, talk about it. The more you build and talk, the more someone is likely to become aware of you.
4. **Luck From Uniqueness** - Uniqueness here means you have something unique about you that draws people's attention. So to carry our bumper car analogy to its final step, this is if you pulled up to the bumper car arena at Frankie's Fun Park with a trailer in tow carrying a custom made bumper car. It's your hobby. It's over the top for most everyone else. But they give you their attention. My example from this I have shared before is when I got my first job by bringing the company over $30,000 contract. I built. I coded. I wrote about it. But by taking it to a unique level they couldn't help but pay attention. You can make this happen for you by going all in on a coding language. If you go all in on CSS people will notice you cause CSS is notoriously difficult. Write about it. Learn something. Build something. Make a video. Teach someone. Make them notice you.

Hope this helps explain the whole 'increase your luck surface area' idea a bit more and how you can use it.

**Random Thought**

I've notice some cool patterns recently on LinkedIn.

I tend to write for an audience of Software Developers/Bootcamp Grads/Self-taught Programmers/Coding Bootcamp Leaders. The patterns I have noticed is that there is remarkable parallel between Solopreneur's and building an audience for a business and what bootcamp grads are trying to do/should do to land a job.

So follow some people outside of your field. I follow a lot of entrepreneur's because most of what they say can be applied to those looking to get a job in a field with 'no experience.'

<LinkedInCallout>
I'll keep it short and sweet this week.

If you have not started posting on LinkedIn, for whatever reason, go write something now. Start today and build a habit of writing on LinkedIn.

What to write about? Keep it simple for yourself. What did you learn today? Sum it up and write a short post on it. Don't feel like you've learned anything today? Share your story. Write why you are changing careers. Already wrote your story? Share some of your daily wins and struggles as you are on your journey.

Make LinkedIn something like a public journal chronicling your journey into your new field.
