## Weekly Reminder

As you change careers and are learning a skill, don't forget to share with the world what you're learning or working on.

1. Write that LinkedIn post
2. Write that blog post
3. Ship what your working on
4. Share what you shipped ðŸ‘†

You are taking a risk. Let us encourage and celebrate your work and journey

## Project Clarity

I saw this question on LinkedIn this week:

> When it comes to projects, how should we build when it comes to showing skills that companies want to see.
> The author is a part of a bootcamp and for their final project they are building a eCommerce platform.

When it comes to projects, the primary goal is to demonstrate skills. I have said before that you want your projects to solve business problems as well.

So how do those 2 things work together?

### What does a company expect?

Simply: A company expects to see skills that lead them to believing, 'This person would be a great fit for our team.'

<span className="font-semibold italic underline">
  You don't have to reinvent the wheel! You can build projects that have been
  built before.
</span>

My fear is that you, dear reader, would read, 'solve business problems' and go looking for actual problems that exist at the company you are applying for.

_**This is not the goal**_.

The goal is to use your newly acquired skills to solve problems that businesses can relate with, i.e business problems.

This is a huge stress reliever, in my opinion, because it frees you from having to innovate on a problem they have.

It frees you up to demonstrate domain knowledge and build relational capital with the business through the projects you build

So what might this look like? For our example, let's go with a blog platform. Here's what skills and problems you take into account while building:

- Users
- Roles and Permissions
- Authentication/Authorization
- User Flow - make the app make sense
- UI/UX - make it look good (use a template if you have too)

What does this demonstrate?

- Ability to think for user permissions based off of role when they log in.
- Make the app appealing for users. We want the exp to be enjoyable.
- You can write code to handle all the things in the list above.

#### eCommerce example

One temptation when building a project is to try to make 'the next big thing.'

So for eCommerce, the temptation is to try to build Shopify and even make it better.

The interesting thing is, this feels like a noble goal. But we have to remind ourselves that these teams are huge. They are well established. They probably don't have certain 'features' for a very legitimate reason.

So instead, focus on the skills needed when building a eCommerce platform. Make the User Experience a delight.

Add your own feature if you want but don't try to 'one-up' these other platforms. Be creative and enjoy it.

Again, the primary point here is this: Don't reinvent the wheel! Use your skills to build the eCommerce platform.

At risk of making you angry to read this again:

Your goal is to build a project that shows skills. We are not trying to get our project acquired. That can come later as you build on the side.

We demo skills because our most pressing need...

**...to get a job** ðŸŽ‰

Hopefully this offers some clarity and de-stresses the project building.

Keep building, keep gaining skills, and sharing what you are learning and building.

If you have topics you would like me to write about please send me an email. If you have a question, someone else does too.

Thanks everyone!

Till next time,
