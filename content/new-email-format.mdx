Hello!

Welcome to my new email format for the Career Changers Newsletter. I am stoked that I finally have this template up and running. The format for this newsletter will generally be an intro, like this one, that includes some light heartedness for your week. Still working out what the short form content will be. For now I'll just say I hope that you are getting ready for the holidays and that the next few weeks are restful for you!

## Get More Profile Views By Adding Skills

Quick tip this week. In the section of LinkedIn where you add your name and where most of us put the title we have at our job, add the skills you know to that section.

Let's take software developers. Instead of this:

> Aspiring Web Developer

Add something like this:

> Javascript | React | SQL | Tailwind | Web Developer

This does a few things for you. Primarily, after listening to Taylor Desseyn, it helps recruiters and profile visitors know exactly what you know and they can provide you better help.

This may seem counter-intuitive because we tend to think that if we leave it broad we will be open to more possible roles. But brevity in this case lacks specificity and therefore those who can offer you help don't know what opportunities you are looking for.

If you learn Javascript but only have something like 'Aspiring Web Developer' or 'Web Developer' without the actual skills you know, you may get offers but they may be for roles and languages you don't know.

_Be specific and you will get specific help_
