## Reminder

As you change careers and are learning a skill, don't forget to look up from time to time and do these 2 things:

1. Ship what your working on
2. Share what you shipped ðŸ‘†

You're hard at work. Shipping what you are working on, whether it's very simple or a completed product, is key to putting something into the world.

Sharing is the next hardest step because of the looming 'threat' of perfection. Don't be deceived by perfection. It'll keep you from creativity and innovation.

In the spirit of sharing, here is a link to my portfolio. It's a work in progress. Primarily I am working on removing that domain name and adding my custom domain name in Amazon Web Services.

### Resources

Today I want to share some simple resources that were instrumental in finding a job within 2 months after finishing my coding bootcamp.

1. Danny Thompson's '[How To Get A Job With LinkedIn](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL54X5yR8qizsMpvTCqUIEFMeEp-chvcxk)' Youtube Series
2. [CoderFoundry](https://www.youtube.com/c/CoderFoundryBootcamp)'s Youtube
   Channel
3. [Represent](https://represent.io) for crafting a resume/cv

CoderFoundry has the best advice on what to build and how to 'win the interview'. Look through their videos, particularly their livestreams, it will be of big benefit.

Here is my favorite [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2QhQsa4wqs) showcasing a students portfolio and projects.

### Clear Perspective

This week was a heavy week. A close friend passed. She was in her late 80's but I had the honor of working with her at least 4 days out of every week for about 3 years.

Death is never comfortable to talk about, so I won't talk long, but one thing that I have grown to realize and, dare we say, appreciate about death over the years is this: If we let it, death can be a teacher.

One of the founders of [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/), Channing Allen, only follows one account on twitter. Everyday this account's only tweet is:

> You will die someday

Everyone interprets this differently. Some run from it. Some avidly get to work and act as if there is no tomorrow.

Some, try to let it teach us to enjoy our days. That the ups and the downs are part of living.

But suffice it to say, death can provide great clarity. Some times I am just so overwhelmed with the cares and concerns of daily life that I forget to live.

So here is your encouragement:

_**You are busy. You are putting in the work. BUT! Don't, please don't forget to live**_.

This is the main message I hope to continue encourage and instill in others while changing careers. That there will always be that 'eternal inner murmur'. It will always be there and death can teach us to truly value life as it is today while working towards a better tomorrow.

Til next time,

Ben
