## Importance of Rest

The importance of rest may not be something you struggle with. But I find that our American culture does a poor job at resting well.

Add to this career changing and rest feels virtually impossible. Why is this? Because we are already so consumed with being busy, that when we are changing careers the faster it can happen for us, the better.

The trouble is that this is the fast track to burnout.

### Case Study: Me

During my coding bootcamp I was up 3 hours before class started. Now we were virtual so I was up. I have my morning routine which is about an hour of devotions/meditation/journaling.

So 2 hours before class I was coding. Class went from 9-5. I would often code later into the evening.

After about a month of this I was dying on the inside. I loved coding but I was growing to resent it.

Now, everyone will be different, but I found that if I was going to wake up early in the morning and code, I could not stay up late and code.

It was wearing on my wife and I, as well as robbing me of joy, in that, coding was supposed to be leading me to a better life.

Now doing get me wrong, there is grit involved but my point is simply this:

**Know your limits. Then rest**.

So everyday after code school finished I would go on at least an hour walk. I would listen to a podcast. I would workout. I would go hang out with friends. I would have my wife keep me accountable to not look at the screen for the rest of the night.

I was revived. Coding was fun again. And I had a life.

### Do Something Avocational

Avocational? Simply this means something that is not normally involved in your 'vocation'.

So say you are learning to code, do something to rest that is not coding. This can be so freaking hard. I love coding. So my work and hobby are the same.

But, I had to learn to be disciplined and do things that are not coding for my sanity of mind and health.

_**Everyone's capacity is different**_. But mine just so happens to be that I have about 2 hours of coding I can do outside of work hours before my eyes blur over and I don't know what I am seeing anymore.

So I go workout. Some days I read. Some days I build and do wood working. Some days I just go hang out with a friend who couldn't care less about coding so that I am guaranteed to not talk about coding for a while.

I do those things which are restful for my soul. For me this is church, friends, family, a nap (I hate naps but I am better for it).

Everyone is different! I cannot say that enough. But put in the effort to find something that takes your mind off of your 'work'.

### How Long?

The next question that always comes up, or for me at least, is 'how long do I rest?' And the answer that I lean towards is...

**Probably longer than you want.**

Why? Because unfortunately we human beings are good at deceiving ourselves. And often times when I am 'resting' I am really just not using my fingers to code but I am thinking about my code or about coding.

So I have to take a longer amount of time then I would prefer so that my mind can 'break away' from work.

Again, some will do this faster than others. Some can compartmentalize really easily. I am not such a person.

So do things that force you to be away and help you to rest.

Go to the beach. Go to the lake (my preference). Serve others in someway where you have to think about someone else. Go to the mountains. Sit in nature. Go canoeing. Eat a good steak. Cook dinner. I don't know. Just something that is enjoyable.

(If you have access, like in the picture, go on a hot air balloon ride. I don't know anyone who does this but the picture makes it look cool ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

Do something that reorients you.

Rest. It is a discipline. It takes more thought than we would like. But is completely worth it.

Til next time,

Ben
