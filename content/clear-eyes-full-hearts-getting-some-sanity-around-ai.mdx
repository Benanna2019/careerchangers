Today, we discuss AI.

Frankly, this will be a long email. So you can either skip this section, grab some popcorn, or just not read, you choose.

Typically for a long form article like this email will be, you need headings. But my goodness, I don't know where to start. So Im just going in. And here....we....go! (To understand how I said this in my head search 'joker and here we go clip' in google.

There is a lot of noise around AI. Like, a lot of noise. And frankly, it is wildly exhausting. There were cool things happening. There are still cool things happening. But what I see happening the most? People are afraid.

_**What comes next is meant to be read extremely sarcastically because this is the common dialogue and feelings around AI**_

(Sarcasm begins)

And if you aren't afraid, many will claim you are woefully ignorant. And if you are afraid, you need to jump on the AI ship now otherwise your fear will become a reality and in a year you will not have a job and the world will be different and you and all your loved ones will suffer, blah, blah, blah.

(Sarcasm ended)

So let's zoom back for a moment and look at a lot of what is happening. Here is a bullet list:

- You can generate images with a line of code
- You can speak into a software that will deploy you a app with a database
- Ask chatgpt anything, it probably knows it
- AI can do certain jobs now by itself that teams of people had to do (look into the chatgpt plugins stuff).
- Chatbots are easier than ever to make

And the list could probably go on but by and large that is the list of what people are doing with chatgpt/large language models (LLM's)

There is impressive innovation happening. And innovation is happening fast. But let's pause. Let's look at history for a minute and look at the human race's record with innovation.

Note: I'm not going to be super specific with individual innovations but more general in terms of how humans have conceptually moved with innovation

From the horse draw carriage to the car, from hand crafted to machine made, and many other automations, the general assumption in life is that what can be made more efficient will be and what can be automated will also be.

As innovation happens, innovation happens faster and faster. That's why the last 50 years have dwarfed the previous centuries of innovation. But there's been innovation through and through.

And low and behold, what do we do? We keep innovating. We find new ways to use technologies, however primitive may have been or are, to do something different and unique in the world.

We are all looking at AI as if it is ending life as we know it. But humans are more complex than that. Whether its fantasies, movies, or just straight fear, we believe a story where everything is aweful, we lose, and everything I have done is for nothing, we are going to suffer, etc, etc.

But let's just be reminded of somethings.

- You can get sushi at a grocery store or you can go to japan and pay 300$ or go to Manilla and pay a couple thousand for sushi with edible gold and comes with diamonds and pearls.
- As the world machine grows and things become more boisterous, humans long for the small town feel.
- Starbucks was thought it would put all coffee out of business but I and countless others prefer local over that nonsense (please don't hate me if you love Starbucks. I drink it occasionally too üòÅ )
- We have brand new sleek looking cars, people still prefer vintage
- Chain restaurants exist and for money and convenience, you can't beat it. And yet most everyone has a restaurant they prefer that is local, or isn't a chain, where they would rather pay more and have a better experience than a chain provides
- To the above point, with chains, why would we still have chefs? Chains have automated food, and yet, true beauty comes from someone who loves their craft and we know that because we see, taste, smell, and generally delight in experiencing someone doing their work with care
- And maybe a point that doesn't get made enough, AI as we experience it is months old, MONTHS! Yes the technology has been being worked on/innovated/built for more than that, but it took years before that came to some type of fruition.
- And, in my mind, maybe the most practical thing, the world and business runs off of rules. The smaller you are in size, the more freedom you have to use AI tools. The larger you go though AI requires serious legal measures. The model has access to whatever data is pumped into it. So companies, corporate companies, have an incredibly long way to go before these things are actually adopted.

Please don't buy into the the lie that in any _**known**_ amount of time all developer jobs will cease. I used the word known intentionally for 2 reasons.

1. It is impossible for anyone to know the future, much less make a prophetic statement about some tragedy that will befall others if they don't do as that person is doing.
2. I firmly believe that things will change. But we all, everyone of us, dislike change so much that change is always gradual. Even things that seem like they change over night, have a long tail, gradual shift in their fallout. (There are certain things that do cause shifts overnight, like Covid, wars, etc but we are talking about something that we are aware of not something that is an unknowable or predictable event)

So keep learning. Keep pursuing the thing you are pursuing. Keep dreaming and make the change you seek to make.

The headline sounds fun but may be misleading.
{"\n"}
But my simple thought is this, sometimes we follow everyone and fill our network with people we don't actually need to be hearing from.

Are their people whose voice, posts, etc always brings you down, scares you, or is not helpful to your day? Mute them, block them, or just unfollow them.

You and I already think about 987229387 things a day, why do I need their thoughts in my head? Go outside, clear your head, and clear up the voices that you let in.

  Keep showing up. Keep putting in the work. Keep innovating. Keep growing. Keep
  sharing what you are doing. Consistency is always best.
