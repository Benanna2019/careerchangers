Hello and happy weekend! I hope you will have a restful weekend.

First, I want to thank all of you for being subscribers. It is profound thing to know I get to have some of your time.

Second, and with that in mind, I will be pivoting this newsletter to be more explicitly for Software Developers. Some of you may think it already is, and that is the point. I have kept it generic since LinkedIn and Network are tips for everyone especially anyone changing careers.

It has become clear to me over time that trying to think for everyone hinders what I can share and makes me try to be more broad in the information shared than specific.

Looking forward to be able to share more specific content on coding tips, things I am learning, alongside networking and LinkedIn tips.

If this makes this newsletter uninteresting to you I completely understand and you can unsubscribe at anytime at the bottom of the email.

Thank you all.

_**First, if that image makes you want coffee, go get you a coffee. It definitely makes me want a good pour over coffee.**_

Today, this section and the LinkedIn tip have a lot of overlap. I found out about the 2022 LinkedIn Algorithm report, a link to this is in the LinkedIn Tip section below.

There are many applicable tips but today I want to primarily focus on curating your network by curating your LinkedIn feed. Curating is a fancy word for filtering (hence the coffee image, its a stretch but you got to from time to time).

This is directly quoted from the report:

> LinkedIn analyzes the type of content you are consuming. Basically, if you watch videos, LinkedIn will show you more. If you skip answering polls LinkedIn will stop entirely showing you polls. This is awesome to me. Why? Well, unlike facebook or other socials, LinkedIn lets you choose what you consume, to a degree. This in combination with the LinkedIn tips can really help you curate your LinkedIn feed to see only relevant information.

So instead of consuming everything on LinkedIn, be intentional for a week or two about passing by undesired content, skipping certain content entirely and interacting with what you would like to see more often. Your feed will reflect that and help you start to have access to higher quality of life information, for you.

_**Extra Thought:**_

If you are on twitter here is what I had to do to make twitter relevant.

Earlier this year I deleted my Twitter profile. At the time I deleted it I had followed anyone and everyone of interest. So with faith based interest, to coding, to hobbies, etc. What this did was unnecessarily put my interest on what I saw.

I was spending inordinate amounts of time reading thoughts from people who, although their thoughts were good in that domain/interest area, I was interacting, consuming and reading all of them and thinking far more about what I was reading in all these areas that I would think about things all day that had nothing to do with work, what I needed to be getting better with or wanted to get a better understanding of.

So after I deleted my profile and after a couple of months I started a new Twitter. I was hyper intentional for a week about only following people in the software engineering ecosystem and those who I know help me think and be better. I was also crazy obsessed with blocking or using the 'not interested in this content' feature when Twitter would share content to me that someone I follow liked.

That is just asking to go down the inevitable rabbit hole stuff I don't need to care about. So be really intentional about what you curate for yourself and don't passively consume. It will help an incredible amount.

The LinkedIn tip this week is more about content you consume.

Did you know you can effectively curate what you see? All of these bullet points are found from the 2022 LinkedIn Algorithm report on Page 6 . If you are interested in this report you can find it [here](https://www.linkedin.com/smart-links/AQEkUlMtVC4cjw/83494e5d-0822-4fb6-bbd2-20c72334377b).â€‹

- From new connections you will see all new posts for the first 2 weeks.
- Commenting on a post increases the chances of seeing the next post from the same author by 70%
- Sharing a post increases the chances of seeing the next post by the same author by 80%
- Following a company page will show you the first post the company publishes after you follow them. There are many more but here is the point I gather from this:

> As you network, follow companies of interest, comment on their posts where relevant and share their posts where relevant as well. This not only leads to seeing more of that company's content, it leads to that company seeing more of you.

This is fascinating to me in that you can curate your LinkedIn to network with who you want to network. Yes this works for people as well but specifically when you are looking for work if you follow the above steps and interact/network that way with companies and people at those companies, it will do wonders for your networking and help you get more out of LinkedIn.
