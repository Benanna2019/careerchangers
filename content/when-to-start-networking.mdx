Good morning and hope your having a great start to the weekend!

Taking a page out of Danny Thompson's book I want to celebrate a big win this week

HE GOT THE JOB!

Jerry Mack is one of the most driven individuals I know. I started mentoring Jerry last year. In that year he taught himself to code, got a job with a crypto startup and most recently landed an awesome full-time role.

Mentoring is an interesting word because it seems to imply some level of hierarchy, which is NOT the case.

I received far more from my time with Jerry than I felt like I gave. Why? You get to serve someone and help them along their journey and watch as they grow and get to where they want to be.

So if you are a teacher, mentor, or in a position of helping others, thank you.

If you are in a season of learning to transition, realize that the thing you just learned today is the thing you are most qualified to teach. It doesn't have to be expansive. But you can mentor and give in that way.

Find time this weekend to serve and give.

Often the question comes up: _**When am I job ready?**_

When it comes to networking this question is usually in the context of a larger question: _**When am I ready to reach out to someone?**_

If you wait until you are 'ready' you will never be ready. Similarly, you should be networking long before you are 'job ready.'

Really networking began with your neighborhood friends. It continued through school. It made its way into your jobs, relationships, etc. Wherever there are relationships, networking is happening. At the core of networking is relationships.

If you are teaching yourself how to code or are in a coding bootcamp, when do you typically network? After you have finished and, in terms of skills, you are 'job ready.' But, you should be networking and using LinkedIn before you even begin your coding bootcamp. Or if you are teaching yourself, start networking as soon as you have made the decision you want to change to this new career field.

Why? Because you want people to see your journey. You want them to know your story. This gives you credibility as you progress. Rather than when you are 'ready' you show up all of the sudden. Showing up all of the sudden, no matter who it is, most people will think you are trying to sell them something.

The best sales happen over time in the course of a relationship being developed, grown, and strengthened.

Start networking now if you haven't already.

The LinkedIn tip this week is simply some perspective on posting and commenting.

This week I listened to a couple podcast episodes with Richard Bliss and started reading his book, DigitalFirst Leadership.

One of things he said multiple times was:

> Commenting is where the engagement truly happens

So, here are my silly metaphors for posting and commenting.

Posting is like showing up to a science fair with your trifold billboard. You stand there hoping someone will walk by, stop, and talk to you about your novel ideas or thoughts.

Another way to think about it is that posting is like standing up in a coffee shop and saying what you have to say hoping someone is interested in what you said and comes and talks to you after. Now that is obviously much more awkward than just posting on LinkedIn but I think the point is there: _**Posting requires others to come to you**_.

Now commenting is like being in an online community that has a local group and you all decide to go to the local coffee shop to meet and discuss ideas and thoughts.

The difference? _**Commenting is you going to where 'they' are**_.

Go where they are.
