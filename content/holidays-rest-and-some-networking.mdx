Merry Christmas!

Thank you all for your giving me your time this past year as this Career Changers newsletter was launched. I am very grateful that you allow me to share with you each week.

I have high hopes for this newsletter and being able to serve you all into and throughout 2023.

Today I want to recognize that many of you are not where you thought you would be. Changing careers is difficult and the holidays bring a particular emotion to the investment you are making.

So if I can encourage you today, please take the next few days and rest. Spend time with those who love you and know that you are loved regardless of where you want to be. Enjoy the holidays.

When I was changing careers during the holidays of 2020, this was something that was incredibly hard for me. But having my wife, family, and friends close by helped me be settled and not despair. If you need to talk about this stuff please reach out.

Merry Christmas and I hope and pray that your time this season is restful and that we will go into 2023 and find success in these endeavors.

With gratitude,

_Ben Patton_

<NetworkingCallout title="Connections Through Conversations" image={`/images/holidays-rest-and-some-networking/hrasnnetworking.png`}>

Networking to me boils down to this:

Networking is making connections through conversation to build social capital, good will, and get to a specific ask.

You may be thinking to yourself, "that's all well and good but how do I know when to ask or reach out to a connection."

That question is always the hard one to navigate for those looking to break into a different industry. So here is how I think about it and I think this will help you as well.

1. **Make connections and reach out to people you have a previous relationship with**
   These are the ideal people you want to reach out too. Why? Because they know you. They have watched your journey for some period of time, even if they just knew you in college, and they do not mind in the slightest having you reach out to them. Some may but most wont.

These are also the people you can get to the point with after the least amount of relationship building. It's ok to reach out and say something like,

> Hey John, it's been a while. I hope you and your family are doing well. I see that you work for company in the tech industry which I am very interested in. You may know that I have been going through a career change and have been learning software engineering. I was wondering if we could set up some time to talk and I could share about my journey, what I am looking for, and job opportunities with your company.

The thing to remember is this: There is no perfect formula for when you reach out to someone.

Be kind. Be courteous. Be interested in them.

And, most of all, be specific with what you are asking for. In this case, we want to set up meetings with people and share our story. We want to hear what they have been up too. And then we want to make our ask.

2. **Make new connections and post daily on LinkedIn**
   Everyone has a weird story of making a new connection with someone and then that person instantly bombarding their DM's. Don't do that. If it is an old friend, that is one thing. They know you. But if it is someone completely new to you, they get weirded out.

So instead, post daily on LinkedIn, and then after you have been posting daily, or sharing links to your blog, then you can reach out.

Why wait? The goal is for them to see some 'proof' that you are sharing/know what you are talking about. Even if you are learning. Once you have posted for a while and shared what you are learning for a while, you have what equates to a 'body of work' that people see daily.

This is how I would suggest doing this:

- Start posting on LinkedIn today
- As you post you will make new connections
- Keep posting daily about what you are learning
- Post at a consistent time daily (I try to post between 8-815 daily)
- If you are a super scheduler, you can write all your content in advance and then use a scheduling app to post to LinkedIn at a specific time
- After a couple weeks or so reach out to this new connection and see if you can set up a meeting.

This will surely yield fewer results than method 1 above. But it is a way to continue building your surface area and have more chances to connect gain opportunities with potential employers.

The more you share what you are doing, learning, building, the more likely you are to have opportunities.

**Bonus: Unexpected Opportunities & Networking Events**
You never know what opportunities will come your way so be open to them.

I had my eyes set on a full-time job. But it also cost me some valuable work experience whenever a potential contract came across my texts or email and it wasn't what I wanted.

So one day I had a relative reach out and mention that an old friend was looking to have an application built for his business. I decided, through the counsel of my wife and friends, to take this contract which ended up leading to my first full time role.

So, in short, don't pass over everything simple because it's not what you want. Think about how you could utilize unexpected opportunities and leverage them to get a full-time job.

And lastly, search for local and online networking events. The goal is literally to connect you with people who can connect you with people and build a network to reach into when you need work, advice, etc.

This week my simple tip is to make use of the featured section on your profile.

Some have called this your 'prime real-estate' on your LinkedIn. Why? The main reason is that this is one of the most 'eye catching' sections of your profile for recruiters and those you are seeking to network with.

Along with the tip from last week, having your skills in the description under your name, having something in the featured section is a way to share the most important things you have as highlights for what you have built.

This is what you want recruiters and hiring managers to look at.

So if you look at my profile, I have my portfolio and a link to the Career Changers newsletter in my profile. These are the two things I want others to know about me.

Put a couple images and links to your best projects there and it will go along way towards making your profile work for you.
