I've been trying lately to think and communicate more on how relationships are the key to finding the first software job in tech.

What I did not expect was to reflect on my jobs that I have had throughout my life and realize that ever single one of them has come as a result of a relationship.

Here is a list of jobs I've had and how I got them:

1. Working with dad - The relationship should be obvious here. However, as I reflect I think on how nice it has been to have time where I worked with my dad, and at times my family. Not important to this conversation of getting a job through relationships but important to me.

2. Summer job as a Janitor - When I was looking for work I knew the CTO (maybe I can't remember but he was important there) of a manufacturing company. I just finished my freshmen year of college and needed work so I took the first thing that came my way.

3. Summer job at Taco Bell - This was a summer mission type of thing where we worked a fulltime job. However, we had a list of places that people had already made connections too. So this Taco Bell already knew they would be getting some employees for the summer. We still had to go through the whole process for formality but it was a done deal before we even applied.

4. Non profit summer leadership positions - You had to be known by the non-profit to even be considered.

5. Non profit full time - fundraised income. Either people knew about the organization, knew me personally, or knew someone close to me and gave for one of those reasons. Meaning, income and job where because of relationships.

6. 2nd non profit full time - same as above.

7. Summer job before coding bootcamp - I knew the CEO's parents and got a recommendation.

8. 1st Software job - got to know the CEO before I knew he was the CEO. Found out he was the CEO and made an offer. I had some freelance contracts that I wanted help with and basically brought them a contract for employment.

9. 2nd Software job - got a company referral from a friend. I made a connection with the recruiter. They were not hiring at the time but when I saw a position come open later, I reached out and she skipped all the other applicants and sent me in for an interview.

10. 3rd Software job - had interacted with someone briefly who advocated for me

11. All freelance gigs - either personally know the individual or I was referred by a mutual friend.

There were points where I had to submit applications but applications without knowing anyone or having years of experience is a fast path to discouragement and hopelessness.

Relationships and relational capital in the job hunting process gives hope and bypassess so much effort spent on something that doesn't work for the large majority of us.

Build relationships. Make connections. Connect over common interest. Don't just use people for what you can get from them. Enjoy something together.
