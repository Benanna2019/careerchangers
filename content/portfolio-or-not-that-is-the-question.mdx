Happy weekend! Hope it is off to a great start.

This week I've been think a lot about patterns and habits. Suffice it to say, if you want to grow in an area, make a habit of doing something.

That is probably obvious advice but we are good at getting in our own way. We are great at starting something and instantly seeing how far ahead someone else is.

So today, instead of comparing yourself to others or looking down on yourself for not being where you want to be:

- Be grateful for where you are
- And keep moving forward. Learn a thing. Build with it. Speak about it. Repeat.Everyone starts somewhere and, if you are like me, you can be a chronic starter.

Here's to growing and getting better.

There has been a lot of questions this week around portfolios. My opinion is you should have one.

So what is the benefit of a portfolio?

- You get to build something else.
- It is your 'real-estate' on the web.
- You can house all your other projects there.
- It is a one stop site for all your potential employers, recruiters, etc to see what you have done. Don't make them go to Github.

Some do not think you should have a portfolio and usually the reasoning is because you should focus on building projects. The only reason I would agree is in the since that you should have other projects built before you build your portfolio. This is simply because you should have something to show.

But if you have built a few projects I would argue you should have a portfolio to showcase them.

Be positive.

That's it. There's a lot of negativity going around platforms. As you look for a job, if you are pretty active on LinkedIn, your potential employer's will see your activity. If you are positive it goes a long way. Likewise, if you are negative, that goes a long way as well in the wrong direction.

So, be positive.
