## Why Have a Content Strategy?

I have seen it too often. Someone starts their career changing journey. Gains the skills. Steps into the job market. And is immediately discouraged because no one will give them the time of day.

Without a content strategy you will most likely not create content nor will you be ready to find a job when it is time.

Consider a content strategy as your 'street cred.'

### What kind of content!

It's important to know what kind of content you are writing.

The goal again is clear. To get üëè a üëè job üëè

So, your primary goal is to be a voice. Plain and simple. You're not building a product. You're not really even building an audience.

You are showcasing your work and building a body of work that shows or does 4 things.

1. You Journey - Stories resonate
2. That you can communicate that to others
3. Your daily or weekly progress
4. Content works for you to build a network

### A 'Lay up' for networking

#### What not to do

Finding connections is good. But the quickest way to lose a connection is to immediately message them about a job.

So don't message your connections for an ask....yet. Take the patient route üëá

#### Do This

When you start learning your skill, begin making connections with people in the field you are changing career's too. You can also find connections of people who are seeking to be friendly to career changers in general.

_**Also, make connections with recruiters**_! There are good and bad recruiters but the job title means that they are for you. Try to find the good ones.

The best way this works is for the duration of the 'training period', that is the period you are learning the skill for your new career, focus on

1. Making connections and
2. Creating content based off of the things you learn

Then, when you are ready to apply for jobs, here is what you have

1. A body of work. Mainly this can be content on LinkedIn or blog posts if you like to write.
2. Credibility. They see that you've been around for a bit.
3. Greater leverage to skip the 'no experience' issue all together because you have experience that can be seen and _**humans like what they can see and use as proof**_.

In summary, here is your action points.

Begin today,

1. Creating content.
2. Making connections with people in your field and recruiters.
3. And wait until you are ready to apply for jobs before you ask your network for jobs.

The last point may seem counter intuitive so here is final thought.

If you wait until you are through with your program and ready to apply for jobs, while having built up a network and body of work (content), this will dramatically decrease the length of time it takes to get a job because it will start working for you when you are seeking a job.

Asking too soon without that 'body of work' can prematurely cut you off from opportunity.

Hope this helps! Let's get to work!

Til next time,
