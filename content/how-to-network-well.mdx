## Networking

This week I've been privileged to have a lot of conversation with those changing careers to software engineering.

There is a growing realization that traditional ways of getting a job, through applications and interviews, don't work with 'zero experience'.

There is a growing interest in networking but always feels shrouded in mystery.

### The Primary Problem

You now have skills. And that is an awesome thing that should be celebrated.

But now you have started to hear, 'You should network.'

But 'network' is never clearly defined.

So here is a simple definition and a breakdown:

_Meeting new people and reconnecting with old friends so as to build a growing group of connections with the purpose of building relationships, gaining attention and increasing your 'luck'._

- The 'group of connections' is your network.
- Take the relationships seriously. Don't just 'use' people but be genuinely interested in connecting with others. And this doesn't mean you have to keep up and know everything about them. But basically, don't be a jerk.
- Gaining attention is the primary goal as you are looking for a career change. Simply, the more people know who you are and what you do the more likely you are to have conversations towards employment
- Gaining attention is increasing 'your luck' of getting a job. We want our sphere of attention and potential for 'luck' to grow.

### How to Become a Good Networker

This week I was at a work event. The instructor of my coding bootcamp started working for a company that is affiliated with ours and so we were at the event together.

My instructor introduced me like this:

> Out of all the cohorts I had, this guy was a networking master. He had people literally lining up to give him money.

Now please understand there is nothing special about me in this regard.

This is the only thing I did differently than others.

I asked.

If you don't ask, they don't know.

If you don't post content on LinkedIn, write a blog, or help people keep up with you, they don't know about you.

So ask. Ask for help. Ask that friend you have at in company for a referral. Go to that networking event and let them know who you are and that you are looking for work.

[â€‹Cassidy Williams](https://twitter.com/cassidoo) talked about her journey
and [how she got to a lot of her opportunities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsBfyUzZhTc). Her simple advice was to ask. There were many opportunities she didn't get but
through asking and asking and asking, she got great opportunities.

Each rejection is just a step forward in the right direction. It doesn't mean you are going backwards. You have to be persistent.

Don't worry about being annoying. If you are, people will let you know. Try to be intentional and not spammy and I think you are fine.

But at the end of the day, you have to ask.

Till next time,

Ben
