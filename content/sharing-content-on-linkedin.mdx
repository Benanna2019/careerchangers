## Creating Content as a Career Changer

I had a great discussion this week on LinkedIn about the importance of content when looking for your first job as a software engineer.

This led to further conversation about, 'what to write?' There are endless styles available.

We will keep it simple.

### Common Fear About Writing on LinkedIn

If you have been on LinkedIn for any amount of time, you have seen a lot of fluff posts.

Meaning, most people are taking any random video, meme, or story and turning it into a deep meaningful fluffy article.

We don't know the people writing so maybe they really mean what they are saying.

The larger point here is this:

Starting to post on LinkedIn does not:

1. require you to write fluff articles and
2. it does not mean what you write will become that type of article.

That type of writing tends to be 'a race to the bottom' and is mostly with the hope of going viral and winning the likes and attention of those 'doom scrolling.'

### How to Write on LinkedIn

Here is the simple process I used to write on LinkedIn when during my coding bootcamp.

1. What did I learn today?
2. Write a blog post from from what I learned
3. Write a shorter LinkedIn post that summarizes #2 and links to the blog page

You may think things similar to this when writing online:

- Someone else has written it better
- Due to 'Imposter Syndrome' we think, 'who am I too educate.'
- Is education the purpose of my writing?
- Someone will see I don't know it all

And thus we refrain from writing.

HOWEVER!, Ryan Florence, a co-founder/creator of React Router, a router downloaded and used by millions daily, says this:

> **The thing you just learned, that is the thing you are most qualified to teach**.

Why? Why are we the most 'qualified?'

As beginners, as career changers, we think like career changers and beginners.

Senior developers rarely, if at all, are able to think as someone just starting out.

You'll see this in youtube videos/tutorials. Someone will breeze through something and you're like, 'wait, wait, wait. What did they just do?'

So what did you learn today? Make a note. Keep a list of topics that have been freshly learned. Write a blog or just write a LinkedIn post.

You are qualified and you will be able to see how your understanding grows overtime.

### Wrapping Up

Writing about what you are learning daily will keep you from fluff articles.

Simple Framework for writing:

- What did you learn today?
- Was it a lot? Then choose one thing from the day.
- Write a blog post
- Condense blog post to post on LinkedIn
- Repeat tomorrow

And, as always....

#### Weekly Reminder

As you change careers and are learning a skill, don't forget to share with the world what you're learning or working on.

1. Write that LinkedIn post
2. Write that blog post
3. Ship what your working on
4. Share what you shipped ðŸ‘†

What did you work on this week? Share it on LinkedIn and [tag me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminapatton/) so I can share it as well.

Thanks everyone and hope you find some of these things helpful/useful!

Till next time,

Ben
