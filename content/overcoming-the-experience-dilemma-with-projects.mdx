## Weekly Reminder

As you change careers and are learning a skill, don't forget to share with the world what you're learning or working on.

- Write that LinkedIn post
- Write that blog post
- Ship what your working on
- Share what you shipped üëÜ

You are taking a risk. Let us encourage and celebrate your work and journey

## 'What Project Do I Build?'

Let's briefly revisit the importance of projects.

You have learned a skill and are applying for jobs. Resumes don't work when changing careers. So we have to demonstrate our skills.

Thus projects. Projects are the 'backdoor'. They are a demonstration of years worth of experience without having years of experience.

### Projects: Passion | Problems | Pain

When it comes to projects, there are 3 categories to typically choose from. Passion, Problems, and Pain.

#### Passion

This category is pretty straight forward. Simply ask the question, 'what am I passionate about and what can I build to show that passion?'

_**The purpose of these projects is too**_ <span className="italics font-semibold underline">simply build</span>.

You are getting reps. More reps help you to learn and gain more experience.

For me, I love building out my portfolio/blog site. It is where I tinker and learn and implement things I learn from my job.

I also like to build small projects that help me learn something quickly so that I can then go try to teach someone else.

The reality is this:

_**You are much more likely to build something if you are interested in it**_.

So be sure to sprinkle 'passion' projects into what you do.

#### Problems

Problems exist all over the place. So we need to be a little more specific.

My friends over at [Coder Foundry](https://www.coderfoundry.com/) have me convinced that the best problems for aspiring software developers to solve are _**business problems**_.

Business problems are things like:

- A bug tracker
- A mortgage loan calculator
- Invoicing system
- Inventory tracking system
- Document Sharing
- Financial Portal

The point of the projects above is that they are big. They have a lot of pieces involved that will demonstrate depth of understanding of how to solve problems with code.

You also do not have to build any of the above. The principle is this:

Build a solution, even if solutions exist already, that shows potential employers that you have the skills to solve problems that they experience and are using some solution for. This shows them that you can think like they do and you can build a solution around it.

#### Pain

This is how to start thinking like an entrepreneur.

- What is a pain you experience that others experience?
- Build a solution to solve that pain
  Here is an example of thinking about pain, experiencing it personally, and thinking about a solution:

> My wife works two part time jobs. She doesn't get paid maternity leave for either of them since they are part time. I have a job that gives me 6 weeks paid paternity leave.
> We are expecting our first later this year.
> It would be awesome to have a way to share benefits.
> So a solution could be built.

Now, granted, the above problem and solution would be incredibly difficult to solve because insurance is the absolute worst.

But the example and principles are there. What are you, your family, or your friends experiencing that others are experiencing as well? How can you build a solution around that and offer it?

To overcome the 'experience dilemma' you have to demonstrate experience. A resume is just a piece of paper. When you build something and show it, it mesmerizes others and catapults you beyond what is on that piece of paper.

So keep in mind:

1. Build passion projects. Tinker. Have fun
2. Build a project to solve a business problem. This will connect and empathize with an employer.
3. Build a project to solve a common pain. This could very well lead you down the path of being an entrepreneur but also demonstrates market attentiveness.

Keep building!
