Good morning!
Whatever you are doing this weekend, may you find time to rest and enjoy a few hours of down time. Here are a few things I do that help me rest a little easier.

Be away from phones and screens (if possible)

Have some sort of chill music playing. I tend to read and listen to Lofi or if the book is epic enough I put on something like Two Steps From Hell. This has made reading incredibly epic üòÇ

Yard work. Doing an ‚Äòavocational‚Äô task that is clearly defined and seeing instant feedback is always fulfilling/restful, for me.

Be around friends and play games, watch a game together, go do something together.

Hold my son and make funny faces. He‚Äôs 4 months so he just smiles and has no idea what my cares and concerns are and that is pretty liberating.

For my family and I, we worship with friends and this is the most restful thing we do. Being in places that reorient us to who we are from a foundational identity perspective is the best thing we can do for ourselves.

Hopefully you are able to pull away today and do something that is restful.

I had my mind melted a bit this week with this statement:

Breaking in to tech with no experience requires a sales process. Without it you will not find a job.

But what is a sales process? Everything comes back to networking and clearly defining what we are trying to do when we network.

I have a few friends who broke into the SDR role. So I have followed them for a while and the sales process the go through.

The most important part of it is this:

You have to have a lead and then you have to take a risk by make a bid for a connection.

I first heard this phrase, bid for connection, in the context of relationship advice for my wife and I. And the point if it here is that making a bid is putting yourself out there. You don‚Äôt know if you will get the thing you are bidding for. But without the bid you cannot get it.

So take a risk and ask. Reach out to recruiters. Reach out to hiring managers. Reach out to those who seem friendly and wanting to help and ask for ‚Äòleads‚Äô for you as you are looking for work.

You will receive no‚Äôs in the form of non-feedback and actual ‚Äúno‚Äôs‚Äù but without it you are stuck in the old process that isn‚Äôt working anyways.

Make bids for connection. The beauty of LinkedIn is that we are all there to connect anyways. It doesn‚Äôt guarantee a desired outcome but it is a really good place to start

Sometimes the hardest part of LinkedIn is getting started. So here is a perspective and simple framework for posting.

Perspective:

I love reading/listening to Seth Godin. Here is his quote on how he writes everyday:

Tomorrow is Tuesday. So Im gonna wake up and write.

It seems pretty simple, maybe even a little dull. But the point is writing when he wakes up is like eating breakfast, or brushing your teeth, or whatever morning habit you have, that is his habit. So don‚Äôt wait for the burst of motivation. Set a habit.

Framework:

This helps you start to internalize what you did throughout the day and be able to put it into words.
