## Goal Setting

I've been thinking a lot recently, a dangerous venture in and of itself, I know.

But I've been thinking a lot about where I want to go in my career.

So today, I hope to share a nugget or two about goal setting.

### Where do you want to be?

This question is a simple one but one that often alludes us. Not because we don't have goals but because it is kind of difficult to think about it.

Like, you ask me what my 5 year plan is, and Im like, 'survive and provide?'

But, when I do think about it, there are things I would love to spend my time doing professionally.

#### Example

I would love to move into Developer Relations/Advocacy one day as my full-time job.

Why? Because I love all aspects of a product development lifecycle. I hate not knowing how to connect what I am doing as a Dev to what Marketing is doing.

Which sometimes looks like I get tired of development but, to me, it is curiosity.

I love learning about design. I love learning what all team members are doing. Once I know what they do, I love giving them resources, and helping them dream of possibilities.

There is this [fantastic post](https://leerob.io/blog/devrel-at-vercel#is-devrel-right-for-me) by [Lee Robinson](https://twitter.com/leeerob), Head of DevRel @ [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), about thinking through working towards Developer Relations.

_**Enough of me, what is something you want to work towards?**_

Now, the counter-intuitive piece of goal setting.

### Don't hold so tightly to outcomes

This simply means:

> Don't focus on the outcome such that you miss the steps you can take today.

So, using me as an example, this is how I have fallen into this trap.

I want to be paid to build things and teach others, that is Developer Relations in a nutshell.

But I cannot focus so much on the paid part because that keeps me from doing what I actually can do, right now, in this moment, today, to put me on a trajectory to do that.

Which is? Start teaching now.

I have refrained from open source and doing a lot of 'teaching' because it is time consuming and not paid.

The piece I am learning to give up? _**The paid part**_.

It is difficult because doing free things requires time and sacrifice from family.

But they are also one of the best ways to give back and give to a community.

**So, for you**:

- What is something holding you back from pursuing a goal?
- What part of your goal do you need to hold more loosely?
- What can you do today, right now, to start on that path?
- Take stock of your time and realistically set time you can put to these things.

_Think Big_. _Start small_. _Go deep_.

Till next time,

Ben
