## Think Differently & Get a Job

This week, [this post]() on LinkedIn resonated with a lot of people.

The post spoke to the pain those of us who went to, are in, or those who plan to attend a bootcamp, feel.

We want a job. We are there to get a job. We are taking a big risk.

### 3 Ways To Think Differently & Get a Job

I cannot say it enough, applying for jobs does not work for 99% of coding bootcamp students/graduates.

We have to think differently. We have to help them think differently.

So here are the 3 ways to think differently.

1. Think Locally
2. Do Something Unique
3. Networking Events

#### Think Locally

I see this too often and I am personally guilty of this, we think to large.

We look at the big companies. Or we hear of people making $100,000 as their first job (which by the way rarely happens, is mostly a marketing ploy, or the job is in a location where $100,000 is barely enough to live off of, like The Bay Area or NY).

Instead, look at jobs available where you live.

Don't live in a big town? Expand to your search to the closest city.

Or, odds are, you could get freelance experience building for local companies, even in your small town.

Start small and expand your search.

Freelance for family and friends and have a website to show what you build. This shows real world practical experience that will help you land a full-time job faster.

#### Do Something Unique

This is how I got my first full-time job.

I knew I needed money. So I started freelancing.

I found out about a friend whose freelancing needs would actually pay me really well.

The contract was for $36,000 paid over the course of 6 months.

I knew I wanted a team of people working on this. His project was really involved.

So I happened to have a recent connection with a CEO of a startup.

I message him and had a meeting where I essentially said:

I will give you the rest of the contract if you give me a job.

What this did for me was two things:

1. It gave me on paper 'experience' because now I could tell people I had my first job as a software developer
2. I was basically paying my own salary by giving them the contract
   So do something unique. Make them notice you.

Bootcamp leaders, help them do things that get them noticed!

#### Networking Events

I was truly shocked to find out how many events there are locally to me. I live in a decent sized city. But there are events everywhere.

This was how I had my first contracting job.

There is a group called Startup Grind. I attended one local event (it was on zoom at the time due to covid) and I just posted I was looking for work.

A founder messaged me and I had a job within a week. It was part-time but it was still a way for me to start doing some work.

Find a Startup Grind event near you. Here are a list of networking events I know of. Some I think are local to me but may be more State wide than I know of

- [Startup Grind](https://www.startupgrind.com/)
- [Tech After Five](https://www.techafterfive.com/)
- [Million Cups](https://www.1millioncups.com/s/)
- [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) (find one near you for what you are
  looking for)

Thanks! Hope this helps someone!

Till next time,

Ben
