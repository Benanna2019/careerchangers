## Tools & Resources to Keep Perspective

I found when I was going through my coding bootcamp, seeing 'where this is all going' was mostly an after thought.

I really sought to keep in my mind things which got me excited for where I could go after learning to code.

So below I have just included some sites to show what is possible and some tools to help you along your journey.

### Resources

#### Games / Interactive Sites

- [Bruno Simon's Portfolio Site](https://bruno-simon.com/) - This was
  the first site that showed me that the web could be so much more than just forms.
- [Poimandres Examples w/ React](https://docs.pmnd.rs) - I am currently
  using this for personal projects. This team has made a lot of high level math stuff
  into simple react components and hooks.
- [Tendril](https://tendril.ca/%20) - Click the toggle in the bottom left
  a few times and you can find different interactive scenes to mess with. You should
  get to one with a forest when you move the mouse over the trees they grow leaves.
  This one blew me away.
- [Rive](https://rive.app/) - Rive lets you build interactive scenes and
  imbed them in your code. Mostly I just like to look at what others have done.

#### Podcasts

- [IndieHackers podcast](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcasts) - This
  was the only podcast I listened too for about a year while learning to code. I
  also credit this podcast with the insatiable desire to want to be an entrepreneur
  one day.

To see those who learned to code, build a product, and now are free to work on it and make it better for customers or get acquired has opened my mind to so many possibilities
Tools

#### Mindset

- [BrainFM](https://www.brain.fm/) - I absolutely love the music here
  for focus, deep work, sleep, etc. There are endless categories of music to choose
  from to listen too.
- [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) - Journaling and writing is how I
  process. I love this journaling app.
- [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/) - Ever been annoyed with the amount
  of ads? Trying to watch a youtube video only to be interrupted 2493198 times? Brave
  removes all ads by default. It has helped my wife and I have a little sanity again.
  But just a little ðŸ˜‚
- [Freedom](https://freedom.to/) - Allows you to set blocks and schedules
  on what websites tend to distract you the most. Then if you try to go there you
  get a green screen. It's very helpful.

#### Planning & Managing Work

- [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) - By far my most preferred planning
  app. Any sort of brainstorming or planning is available. Like mind maps, simple
  todo set ups, docs, wireframes and a ton of templates.
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - Notion lets you do just about anything
  you can think of. You can turn simple pages into websites. You can use it in combination
  with other no/low code tools and make it your database. I use this for course planning.

#### Video

- [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) - Loom is by far the easiest and most
  accessible video site/app I have ever use. Simple create a free account. Add the
  chrome extension. Then when ready to make a short video, click the extension and
  start video.

And as always....

### Weekly Reminder

As you change careers and are learning a skill, don't forget to share with the world what you're learning or working on.

1. Write that LinkedIn post
2. Write that blog post
3. Ship what your working on
4. Share what you shipped ðŸ‘†

What did you work on this week? Share it on LinkedIn and tag me so I can share it as well.

Thanks everyone and hope you find some of these things helpful/useful!

Till next time,

Ben
