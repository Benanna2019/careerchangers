Good morning! Hope your weekend is off to a great start!

This week was challenging for me and great in many ways. One of these 'clarity' moments for me was that there are a lot of things I want to do and I have endless reasons for not doing them.

So over the next few weeks I will be adding a new section to the newsletter for 'Projects'. The goal of this section will be to showcase something I am working on while putting my personal 'twist' on it.

A few examples:

- Up to this point I have had a standard portfolio. Meaning it is either copying what someone else has done, using a template, or piecing together things. I want to add unique elements to the portfolio/personal.
- Build out projects that you can follow along with that look good on portfolio/resume.
- Build projects with [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/examples) and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to build enjoyable web experiences
- Ship careerchangers.dev and have content developers can reference for networking, using LinkedIn, projects to build, etc.

I want this year to be a year of shipping creative work. I want it to be a year of 'finishing' projects other things.

Be on the lookout for the new section in the next week or two!

<NetworkingCallout title="Another Look At Fundraising" image={`/images/when-am-i-job-ready/waijrnetworking.png`}>

Since 6+ years of my life my income was made through fundraising, the parallels between fundraising and networking continue to come to me.

Today's simple fundraising tip for networking is knowing your 'why'. In fundraising this is normally discussed in terms of mission & vision.

But in networking, it is knowing your 'why'. Your 'why' helps you have more purpose behind what you build. It helps you speak with greater emotion and clarity. And you don't have to always share your why in networking meetings but if you go into conversations without one most of the time we don't feel the conversation productive nor does the other person really feel they understand us.

So for me, my heart is that I would be able to care for others and put their interest above my own. When I was doing non-profit/counseling that seemed clear enough. But once I started learning to code I was left wondering, 'How does this help me help others?'

And the answer became clear, "Coding is a skill not many know but many can benefit from. There are countless people in my life who I can 'care' for through code." That helps me speak with clarity and know what opportunities to go for and not go for.

I was asked this week, "when do you know you are job ready?"

The answer to this question could go on and on. However, the simplest answer is that you need to have a big project to demonstrate a comprehensive coding skills.

But I want to take that one step further.

You have to be able to talk about what you built. Why? Because often times we build projects either with a tutorial or some other walkthrough and we get to the end and we don't know how to explain it to someone other than to say, "Hey, look at this cool thing I built."

So instead of just having a big project that you followed along with and built, have a big project you can explain to someone. This ensures you understand each piece of the project, the problem being solved, and how it was solved.

**So how does this help me on LinkedIn?**

The goal is to post semi-frequently. So at least 2-3 times a week. If you are having trouble thinking of something to say, build out your project, and at each point write down what it is you learned.

Now you have public learning documentation that others can help you process so that when it comes time to explain it to a potential employer, you are not left explaining what it does BUT _**how it works**_.
