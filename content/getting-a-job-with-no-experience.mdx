## What is Your Job Goal?

You are putting in the work. You are changing careers. Take a few minutes to think about the goal, because, in the end, it does in fact matter.

### Internship, Full-time, Part-time, oh my!

When you start looking & applying for a job it is important to decide what you are willing to accept as an offer.

For example:

For me, I would not accept anything less than a paying job. I knew I had no experience so I was ok if that job was freelancing or part-time.

But, I was not willing to take an internship position not knowing when I would potentially be offered a full-time position. There were too many unknowns and I have a family.

Making this decisions helps narrow down options and give you clarity in the process.

### Overcoming 'no experience'

#### Build Projects

The first thing you must do as someone who is new to the field is build out a project or two or three that demonstrates skills.

Solve business problems. This helps the company relate to you when they see that you have built a solution to a common problem they experience, _**even if there is an existing solution**_.

You are demonstrating the ability to

1. Notice problems and pains experienced and
2. Showing that you are able to provide a solution

Building projects cannot be emphasized enough but now, back to jobs.

_**Accept <span className="underline">the first job</span> that meets your 'criteria'**_

So for me what this looked like was accepting the first paid job I was offered, even though it was part-time and wasn't the best paying. The goal here was to demonstrate that I had a job.

Then, you can start leveraging that as you look for jobs. I started the part-time job acknowledging and letting the company know that if I was offered a full-time gig I would take it.

Be honest about your plans. Keep the company updated.

### Get Creative

After about a month I was determined to get a full-time job. I was working a part-time job and doing freelancing. What this turned into was me working all-day everyday and not having good boundaries.

So here is my somewhat unorthodox example of how I got my first full-time job.

#### Leveraging freelancing

I had a friend who really needed a big piece of software built. In short I had a contract with him for 6 months for $x amount.

I saw a full-time software developer position come open and I new someone who worked at the company as the CEO.

Basically I told this person:

Hey, I will give you this contract for $x amount if you give me a job.
Essentially I was coming to work for nothing. I wanted help on the project and to me experience was of higher value than the money.

_**Disclaimer**_: This is not for everyone. There is a lot of potential headache that can come from this but again, the goal was to have a full-time job.

And remember, in tech, it is pretty common to switch jobs every 6-12months. This is not a sign of anything bad, it is just how quickly experience becomes valuable.

So get creative in how you leverage your other experiences. It will resonate with someone.
